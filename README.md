Youth Diagnostic and Development Center – “Bucket” Automation Project
Excel Tool Development – Albuquerque, NM
Situation:
At the Youth Diagnostic and Development Center, mandated overtime was scheduled daily using a “bucket” system. The system was intended to rotate overtime fairly, but it was tracked manually and was consistently inaccurate, causing frustration among staff and extra work for managers.
Task:
I identified the need for a reliable, easy-to-use tool to automate the “bucket” calculation. My goal was to reduce errors, save time for managers, and ensure fairness in overtime distribution across staff.
Action:
On my own initiative and outside of working hours, I developed a dynamic, user-friendly Excel workbook. I used advanced Excel functionality—including nested formulas, dropdown lists, macros, and automation features—to streamline data entry and calculation. While security restrictions prevented me from integrating directly with the facility’s internal system, I designed the workbook to minimize manual inputs while maximizing automation.
Result:
The final product required only a few daily data entries and could generate an accurate, updated “bucket” rotation at the press of a button. This significantly reduced the administrative burden for managers and improved fairness and transparency in overtime assignments.
